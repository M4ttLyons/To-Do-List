# To Do List
This is the first project I completed when I was beginning to learn React, in this case it was ReactJS. You are able to add new items to the list, as well as delete items once completed. You can also edit items which are already on the list. This web page usilizes local storage to allow them to be read again when the web page is opened back up.

## Learning Outcomes
This project gave me a few valuable learning experiences:
* It gave me my first experience with ReactJS and React in general
* It was my first practical experience with JavaScript
* It gave me an introduction into using localStorage with React
